# 👋 Welcome to my shrine to the arcane arts of coding and version control 🧙‍♂️
## ⚠️ Here be dragons 🐉
The road ahead is fraught with danger 🪧, code goblins lurk in the shadows 🧌, bugs poke and prod relentlessly 🦟, and after midnight the swamp mist is so thick, you can't even see your gauntlet in front of your leathery, gnarled, worn in, been donated to the thrift store five times, face 😶‍🌫️. So welcome, stranger, this is a land of enchantement and wonder 🤔. Sure, dangers abound plentifully, and sometimes the villagers taunt and throw rocks at you 🪨, but there are also unicorns 🦄, faries 🧚, swamp mermaids 🧜‍♀️, and kitty cats 🐈‍⬛, lots and lots of kitty cats, like I think the witches keep dropping them off somewhere nearby 🧙‍♀️. Anyway, I'll let you get back to your journey, farewell stranger, I hope you find what you're questing for.

## About me:
Ask my psycholgist, he'd describe me as "Vell, Tim is just zis guy, you know?" My name is Tim, I'm a software devloper, writer, philosopher, and human. I live on planet earth in a semi mountainous region of the North American continent know as 'Montana.' In all seriousness, this is my main GitHub repository, and here you'll find projects I've worked on.

## Featured projects:  
Both of these projects are SvelteKit apps demonstrating tailwind CSS (UnoCSS), reactive variables, fetch() requests to an API, and JSON parsing.  

[svelte-pokedex @ vercel](https://svelte-pokedex-one.vercel.app) I'm pretty proud of the UX/UI on this project, it works great!

[svelte-itunes @ vercel](https://svelte-itunes.vercel.app) Not a huge fan of this UX/UI, or the quality of the API itself. Meh.
