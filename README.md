Hi, there.

I'm Tim Sonner, I am a self taught iOS developer. My focus is on the latest Swift version 5.5, SwiftUI 3.0, and XCode 13. I'm trying to break into the industry and this is my portfolio, I figure by the time iOS 15 becomes the industry standard, I will be confident in my skill set and able to take on developer roles in an enterprise environment. It may be in a couple years, may be sooner, who knows, but I am putting in the work and coding. 

Sincerely, Tim Sonner
